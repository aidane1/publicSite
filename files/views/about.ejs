    <h2>What: </h2>
    <span class = "tab"></span>As the title of the website suggests, this is the PVSS student website.
    <br>
    <h2>Why: </h2>
    <span class = "tab"></span>I originally decided to make this site because I was unable
    to view my schedule on the SD83 webite, on account of the terrible loading time. This is an issue faced not just by me, but by the majority of the rural community
    of armstrong. In a day an age where the internet is the main source of information and connection between people, this is unacceptable. So, to fix this issue,
    I made pvstudents.ca - the PVSS student website. This website was designed to have incredibly fast loading times (0.896 seconds vs 22.430 seconds on 3g). Additionally,
    It was tailor made to be used on mobile - both as an app and a website (apologies to android users - im working on it).
    <br>
    <h2>How: </h2>
    <span class = "tab"></span>This website is run on a digitalocean server, running ubuntu. The server is run on nodejs, connecting to
    a mongoDB database. On of the contributing factors to the speed of the front end is the lack of external libraries. everything
    run on this website was written by me, explicitely for use here. If you'd like to view the code, it can be found
